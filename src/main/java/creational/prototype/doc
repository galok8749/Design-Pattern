1. Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and
requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing.

2. Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object
and then modify it according to our needs.
Prototype design pattern uses java cloning to copy the object.

3. Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database.
Now we need to modify this data in our program multiple times, so itâ€™s not a good idea to create
the Object using new keyword and load all the data again from database.

4. The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object and
then do the data manipulation.
Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the copying feature.
It should not be done by any other class.

5. If the object cloning was not provided,
we will have to make database call to fetch the employee list every time.
Then do the manipulations that would have been resource and time consuming.
